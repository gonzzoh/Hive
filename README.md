# Nest
This is my third and final project as a student under General Assembly.

Nest is an inventory tracking website for trucking companies, shipping companies, or any business that wants to log their inventory. This is the basic funtionality of Nest. The stretch goals for Nest would be to enhance the focus on the shipping aspect of the application. Using a map api I would like to implement the option to "ship" out cargo, and display the quickest posible route on the map.
